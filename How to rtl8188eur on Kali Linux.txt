 - rtl8188eur installation instruction by trueToastedCode -

-> This method worked for me 100%. Some steps are just to make make it
   work for most people, wich are not necessary for all. If you don't know
   what to do, just follow everything line by line ;D

----------------------------------------
[Install dependencies]
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo reboot (If upgraded something)
sudo apt install bc

[Unload current driver]
(Stick apapter in)
sudo rmmod r8188eu.ko
sudo -i
echo "blacklist r8188eu" > "/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf"
exit

[Install & load new driver]
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8188eus
cd rtl8188eus
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe 8188eu
sudo update-initramfs -u

[To proof that it is 100% working]
sudo reboot

[Start monitor mode]
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor

----------------------------------------
[Fix for "no such device (-19)" (...)]
We can try to load the driver manuell:
(Stick Adapter in)
sudo rmmod r8188eu.ko
sudo modprobe 8188eu
(Stick Adapter out and in again)
Now try @[Start monitor mode]
